        <h2>Get Into Drone Flight!<img id="mydrone" src="rtfDrone.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Ryan Ringer's Drone"></h2>

        <p>FPV drone racing has become my favorite hobby in recent years. The process of building a machine capable of flying at ludicrous speeds and that can perform at an unbelieveable level is one of the most rewarding things I've experienced. While on the outside, this hobby seems complicated, and in some aspects it is, the concept of buliding a literal quadcopter from the ground up can be simplified to the same level as buliding a PC. The only real difficlty is the soldering skill that is necessary to ensure the quadcopter stays in one piece in the air.</p>

        <h3>What's in a Drone?</h3>
        <P>Like a PC, a drone is made up of 7 essential parts:</P>
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Frame<img class="listimage" src="droneFrame.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Drone Frame"></dt>
            <dd>Possibly the most recognizable part of a done. This is the structure that holds the machine in one piece and acts as the platform on which a drone is constructed.</dd>

            <dt>2. Motors<img class="listimage" src="motors.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Four Drone Motors"></dt>
            <dd>Obviously There needs to be a mehod of spinning the propellors, this is that method. Motors range from powerful and inefficient to slow and miserly. This option also tends to determine what battery is used.</dd>

            <dt>3. ESCs<img class="listimage" src="esc.jpg" height="150" width="233" alt="Electronic speed controllers"></dt>
            <dd>Electronic Speed Controllers. These are the small voltage regulators that take the signal from the flight controler and send the appropriate amount of power to each motor. There is one ESC for each motor.</dd>

            <dt>4. PDB<img class="listimage" src="pdb.jpg" height="150" width="210" alt="Power distribution board."></dt>
            <dd>Power Distribution Board. Fairly insignifigant but extremely vital on large quads. This board take the power from the battery and send smaller voltages to the other parts of the quadcopter.</dd>

            <dt>5. Flight Controller<img class="listimage" src="fc.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Flight Controller"></dt>
            <dd>This is the brain of the entire machine. This is the only part that need to be programmed. This will have almost as many wires attached to it as the PDB, but is often independent of the video system. </dd>

            <dt>6. VTX<img class="listimage" src="vtx.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Video Transmitter"></dt>
            <dd>Now we are leaving the flight hardware and moving to the video system. The Video Transmitter is the item responsible for sending the video feed from your drone to your eyeballs.</dd>

            <dt>7. Camera<img class="listimage" src="runcam.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Camera"></dt>
            <dd>Of course, if you're sending a video signal from the VTX, then you're going to need somewhere that signal is created. You really arent going to be filming the next blockbuster with this but you will definitely be able to see which way the ground is.</dd>

            <dt>8. You<img class="listimage" src="point.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Finger pointing at user"></dt>
            <dd>Finally of course the last thing needed is a pilot at the sticks. Stay committed and do your research. Be sure to practice as often as possible and you will find yourself impressing the sixty-year-olds at your local RC club.</dd>

        <p>There are of course other parts you need. Items like a radio, a set of video goggles or a monitor, and batteries are all necessary before take off. But in the end the complicated part that offputs most potential pilots, is the daunting task of assembly. I say don't worry too much. You're going to mess up, we all did. You're going to crash into a tree on your first day and break something, we all did. But as long as you keep getting back in the air, this hobby can be extremely fun and enjoyable.
