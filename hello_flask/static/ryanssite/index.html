        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Thank you so much for visiting my website. My name is Ryan Ringer and I would like to tell you a little about myself. On this site, I have placed various resources that will allow you to learn more about me. If you would like to learn more about my hobbies and interests, (or if you'd maybe like to grab me something off of one of my wishlists) you can check out my "Favorite Links" page. For professional inquiries, please head to the "Resume Page". The "Drones" pages will give you some information on some of my custom built, racing quadcopters. It will also tell you about the parts in a quadcopter and show you some quadcopters that are available for purchase. Finally, if you have any questions or other feedback you'd like to send me, feel free to use the "Feedback" page to send your valued opinions. Don't forget to check out the rest of the page you're currently on to learn more about me.</p>

            <h3>My Personal Interests</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I play video games religiously.</li>
                <li>I like to build, and fly mini-quadcopters; this is the equivalent to skateboarding to me.</li>
                <li>I also like spending time, or "wasting" as family members put it, learning about items that are not necessarily related to my field of study or my career path.</li>
                <li>Cooking is a newer interest of mine, if for nothing else than to show my family how it's done.</li>
                <li>I am also in the process of teaching myself to play guitar.</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I tend to write code in the same format for all classes, which is an issue considering that the HTML used to create this web page is not white space agnostic.</li>
                <li>Often times I look at my phone screen as a mirror to make sure my hair still looks good.</li>
                <li>When it comes to the ladies, I <b><i>always</i></b> shoot out of my league... and usually fall flat on my face.</li>
                <li>I also have a pevuliar interest in waiting until the last minute to complete assignments.</li>
                <li>And I have spent like 500 hours trying to get this column to not overflow into column two. So I'm just going to use what looked best.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Richard Skeate</h3>
            <img id="gpaimg" src="gpa.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="My Grandfather" />
            <p>This is my grandfather, Rich. He recently passed away but he was one of the most motivational people in my life. He is a Marine and a Vietnam veteran. He also served as a grand juror and as bishop for his ward. On a personal level, he was perhaps the one most responsible for my pursuing of a college degree. Considering hat the rest of my family would have been fine if I simply graduated and joined the workforce, having someone like my grandfather around to tell me to not waste my time in any position that I'm not happy in was extremely motivational.</p>
